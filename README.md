# TubeRing

When I started my youtube channel, I found it is hard get any traffic. 
I published a video 3 months ago, and I got 9 views only.
if you are facing the same issue, you find the right place. 

TubeRing is PC client to exchange free youtube views, likes, comments, subs 
completely automatically.

- It should be safe, real users, just like you and me. 
- It is built for the lazy people. After you setup your channel, you don't need to do anything. 
- It supports realtime tracking, you know how the campaign runs, how many engagements you get, and the campaign history. 
- You have full control of your channel, you can specify how many videos to campaign and when to stop. 

## Install

- Download the newest release. [https://github.com/minionbrowser/tubering/releases](https://github.com/minionbrowser/tubering/releases)
- Unzip and run tubering.exe

> Windows only for now. If you need mac/linux version, submit an issue. I will work on it. 

## How it works
